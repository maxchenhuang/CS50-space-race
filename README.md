--[[ DESCRIPTION:

The game is played by 2 players each controlling a rocket ship. The goal is to gain the most points before the time runs out.
You win a point by crossing the screen without getting hit by an asteroid.
If you are hit, you respawn at the starting position.
If you successfully cross the screen, your point counter increases by one and you respawn at the starting position.
There are no penalties for getting hit by an asteroid.
The asteroids move across the screen at varying speeds and their speed tends to increase as the game goes on to add difficulty.

--[[ CODE:

The game is written in Lua, and you may run it with LOVE framework (https://love2d.org/).
The code is included in the folder named "space_race" along with all the audio files and fonts that were used in the game.

I never coded before and it seemed like a world I could never immerse myself in.
Now, thanks to CS50, I know my way around things.
I know how to check the documentation.
I know how to find help on Reddit and Stack Overflow,
I know there is an online community that supports each other.
